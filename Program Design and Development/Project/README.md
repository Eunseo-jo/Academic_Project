# CSCI 3081W - Program Design and Development

+ Project Iteration 1 is to develop an image processing program that can perform several filtering operations (threshold, blur, sharpen, color, etc) including Canny edge detection. This will build the image processing infrastructure necessary for analyzing images returned from a drone's camera.

+ Project Iteration 2 is to develop a drone simulation that uses simple computer vision techniques to search for an object in a scene.  The simulation will use the image processing infrastructure developed in Iteration 1.

+ Project Iteration 3 is to use the drone simulation from iteration 2 to rescue the robot. 
Our team develop drone function of component test for Factory, Data Collection, Recharge Station, Entity Factory, Patrol Drone movement, Manual movement pattern, Beeline Drone movement, Find robot part. Then implement robust testing for system.This includes unit, component, integration, and regression testing. 

### My role is Image Processor Facade, Simulation Facade, Battery Decorator and Google Testing in tests folder.
