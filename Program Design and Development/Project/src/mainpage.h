 * \section gettingstarted_sec Getting Started
 *  Our project can be cloned using this GitHub repository link (SSH version):
 *   git@github.umn.edu:umn-csci-3081-f21/repo-team-24.git 
 *
 *  To build and run our project on a Linux machine there are three steps:
 *  Navigate to the project (not Project!) directory on a CSE lab machine terminal and run “make -j”. This will create a folder called build where the executables are located.
 *  Run the project by entering “./build/web-app 8081 web” into the terminal
 *  Then open a browser (we recommend Firefox) and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081/ to see a visualization of our simulation.

 * \section howtocontribute_sec How to Contribute
 *  There is a multi-step process to adding new features and enhancements to the project.  
 *  First, you should create an issue with a brief description of the feature/enhancement. Then you need to create a branch for the specific feature/enhancement. If there is already a branch that can be used then there is no need to create a new one. Once you make changes to the branch and are ready to add the new feature/enhancement to the project you must create a pull request to merge this branch with the develop branch. This pull request must be reviewed and approved by one other person before the new changes can be merged to the develop branch. From here in order for these changes to develop to be pushed to our main branch they must be approved by two other members. 
 *	Any code that is to be added to the project must fit our coding standards. Our standards require proper commenting and documentation, memory management, and adhering to naming conventions. We used the Google C++ code style guide to set our standards and this can be used as a reference when making contributions to the project.
